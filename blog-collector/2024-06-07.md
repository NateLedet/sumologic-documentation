In this release, we've enhanced the security and stability of the Collector with added bug fixes.

- Upgraded `Install4j` to version 10 for macOS.
- Fixed the collector start issue by cleaning the temporary files on Windows.
- Fixed the Linux RHEL OS (version 8.3 and above) starting collector issue which has OS level FIPS mode enabled.
