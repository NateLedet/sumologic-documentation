The Data Deletion feature allows you to request the removal of ingested data from Sumo Logic, which can be particularly useful for sensitive or inadvertently ingested data.

Accidental ingestion of sensitive data due to misconfigurations, developer errors, or third-party sources can pose significant compliance and security risks. This feature provides a swift and accurate solution to mitigate such risks.

Key Features:

- User-friendly data deletion
- Support for multiple datasets and time ranges
- Customizable filters
- Robust auditing mechanisms
